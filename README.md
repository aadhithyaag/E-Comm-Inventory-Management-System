# E-Comm-Inventory-Management-System
Software Application to facilitate management of an Inventory for E-Commerce Retailers

This is a project I did for School in regards to the subject Software Engineering. The idea behind this app is to allow E-Commerce Retailers to keep track of the amount of stock present for each product they sell on multiple E-Commerce platforms such as Flipkart, Amazon and so on. Upon keeping track of the stock present, dead stock (stock which isn't being sold and is present in the inventory for a long time) can be removed and in situtations of natural disasters, stocks can be identified and kept out seperately to hlp the needy.

Interesting Features included are as follows:
**1. Secure Login through a secret password which is stored in a text file. Text file is further secured by performing encryption using DES Algorithm.**
**2. User-Friendly interface, easy to understand and use.**
**3. Details of Products can be viewed through particular search filters based on necessary product details and can be updated if necessary.**
**4. Information of Suppliers for various products can be viewed and updated if necessary.**
**5. Order Details from various E-Commerce Platforms can be viewed and updated if necessary.**
**6. Database consists of triggers which update amount of stocks automatically once any order is sent out for delivery.**

The whole project is done using Python. Front End User Interface is developed using tkinter module, back-end connection to the database is also done using Python. Database for the project is created using MySQL.
